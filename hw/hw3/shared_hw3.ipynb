A side advantage of this would be that with a bigger test split, we'll have a more reliable estimate of the model performance!_"

Good idea to apply one-hot encoding to encode the categories as numbers, and imputation for missing values. We choose one hot encoding over ordinal encoding because we aren't weighing one occupation higher than another|\n",

    "In this exercise, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for the hyperparameter `C` of SVC RBF classifier. In practice, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for all different hyperparameters of the most promising classifiers. For the purpose of this assignment, we'll only do it for the `SVC` classifier with one hyperparameter, namely `C`. \n",

    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each `C` value in the `param_grid` below: \n",
    "    - Create a pipeline object with two steps: preprocessor from 4.4 and `SVC` classifier with the `C` value.\n",
    "    - Carry out 5-fold cross validation with the pipeline.  \n",
    "    - Store the results in `results_dict` and display results as a pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "2. Which hyperparameter value seems to be performing the best? Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the best CV score.) Is it different than the default value for the hyperparameter used by `scikit-learn`? \n",

This can lead to developers being confident in the model during testing, but having the model fail in deployment.\n",
